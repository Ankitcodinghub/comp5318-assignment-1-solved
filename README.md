The goal of this assignment is to build a classifier to classify some grayscale images of the size 28√ó28 into a set of categories. The dimension of the original data is large, so you need to be smart on which method you gonna use and perhaps perform a pre-processing step to reduce the amount of computation. Part of your marks will be a function of the performance of your classifier on the test set.

2 Dataset description

The dataset can be downloaded from Canvas. The dataset consists of a training set of 30,000 examples and a test set of 5,000 examples. They belong to 10 different categories. The validation set is not provided, but you can randomly pick a subset of the training set for validation. The labels of the first 2,000 test examples are given, you will analyse the performance of your proposed method by exploiting the 2,000 test examples. It is NOT allowed to use any examples from the test set for training; or it will be considered as cheating. The rest 3,000 labels of the test set are reserved for marking purpose. Here are examples illustrating sample of the dataset (each class takes one row):

3.1 How to load the data

To read the csv file and load the data into a dataframe using pandas.

The training data files are in the ./Input/train and testing data file are in ./Input/test. Use the

4 Task description

Your task is to determine / build a classifier for the given data set to classify images into categories and write a report. The score allocation is as follows:

1. Code: max 65 points 2. Report: max 35 points

Please refer to the rubric in Canvas (Canvas -&gt; Assignment1 -&gt; Rubric) for detailed marking scheme. The report and the code are to be submitted in Canvas by the due date.

4.1 Code

4.1.1 The code must clearly show

<ol>
<li>Pre-process data</li>
<li>Details of your implementation for each algorithm</li>
<li>Fine-tune hyper-parameters for each algorithm and running time</li>
<li>The comparison result between 4 different algorithms including 3 single methods and one
ensemble method
</li>
<li>Hardware and software specifications of the computer that you used for performance eval-
uation
</li>
</ol>
4.1.2 Data pre-processing

You will need to have at least one pre-process techique before you can apply the classification algorithms. Pre-process techique can be Normalisation, PCA, etc.

4.1.3 Classification algorithms

You will now apply multiple classifiers to the pre-processed dataset. You have to implement at least 3 classifiers in particular:

1. Nearest Neighbor

2. Logistic Regression 3. NaiÃàve Bayes

4. Decision Tree

5. SVM

and one ensemble method:

1. Bagging

2. Boosting

3. Random forest

For binary classifiers, we can use those classifiers for the data which has more than 2 labels using the one-vs-rest method. The implementation can use sklearn, or can be implemented from scratch.

4.1.4 Parameter Tuning

For each classifiers we would like to find the best parameters using grid search with k-fold (k&gt;=5) cross validation.

4.1.5 Classifier comparisons

After finding the best parameter for each algorithm, we would like to make comparisons between all classifiers using their own best hyper-parameters.

4.2 Report

4.2.1 The report must clearly show:

<ol>
<li>Details of your classifiers using for assignment 1</li>
<li>The predicted results from your classifier on test examples</li>
<li>Results comparison and discussion</li>
<li>Following the format in rubric : Introduction -&gt; Methods -&gt; Experiments result and discus-
sion -&gt; Conclusion
</li>
<li>The maximum length of the report is 10 (excluding appendix and references)</li>
<li>Clearlyprovideinstructionsonhowtorunyourcode,hardwareandsoftwareenvironments
in the Appendix section of your report
</li>
<li>Detail of student including ID, name.</li>
<li>Please also refer rubric on Canvas for more detail</li>

2. Code (2 files include: a .ipynb file and a PDF file). PDF is exported from .ipynb file for plagiarism check.

The code must be able to be run with the following folder structure:

<ul>
<li>Notebook file (in the root folder): Your .ipynb file containing all Python code. The PDF file is generated from .ipynb file (File =&gt; Save as PDF file).</li>
<li>Input and Output folders: We will copy Input folder including all data and Output folder along with your notebook file to run your code. Please make sure your code is able to read the dataset from this Input folder and generate the output file to Output folder. (No need to submit the dataset and folder)</li>
</ul>
3. tput file (test_output.csv).

If this is an individual work, an individual student still have to register the group on Can- vas and submit all the files which must be named with student ID numbers following format e.g. SIDxxxx_report.pdf, SIDxxxx_code.ipynb, SIDxxxx_code.ipynb.pdf.

If this is a group work of 2, all students need to form a group on Canvas and one student submits all the files which must be named with student ID numbers of 2 mem- bers following format e.g. SIDxxxx1_SIDxxxx2_report.pdf, SIDxxxx1_SIDxxxx2_code.ipynb, SIDxxxx1_SIDxxxx2_code.ipynb.pdf.

5.2 Submit to Kaggle

Go to Kaggle -&gt; Join Competition -&gt; Data (Download dataset) -&gt; Submit Predictions

We use the Kaggle leaderboard for assignment 1. Follow the steps below to use the leaderboard:

<ol>
<li>Use the Kaggle link to join the competition, you need to create a Kaggle account if you don‚Äôt have one.</li>
<li>Go to Team -&gt; Use your Canvas Group ID as your team name. You can create a Kaggle team with up to 2 members.</li>
<li>Go to Description -&gt; Check the IMPORTANT NOTES for the assignment.</li>
<li>Go to Data -&gt; Download the training data, build your models.</li>
<li>Submit Predictions -&gt; Follow the submission format and submit your prediction output file (test_output.csv).</li>
<li>Leaderboard -&gt; Check your accuracy score at the Leaderboard.</li>
</ol>
IMPORTANT: This link is only available to the students of COMP5318. All groups need to submit test_output.csv to Kaggle for marking puporse. Only 5 submissions are allowed per day for Kaggle. Group ID on Canvas and Kaggle have to be unique otherwise the submission will not be marked for the Accuracy part.

A penalty of MINUS 5 percent (-5%) for each day after the due date.

The maximum delay for assignment submission is 5 (five) days, after which assignment will not be accepted.

You should upload your assignment at least half a day or one day prior to the submission deadline to avoid network congestion.

Canvas may not be able to handle a large number of submission happening at the same time. If you submit your assignment at a time close to the deadline, a submission error may occur causing your submission to be considered late. Penalty will be applied to late submission regardless of issues.

All files required for Assignment 1 can be downloaded from Canvas -&gt; Assignments -&gt; Assignment 1

6 Inquiries after releasing the marking

After Assignment 1 marks come out, all inquiries about marking need to contact the marker

within 1 week. All inquiries after that will be ignored. 7 Academic honesty

Please read the University policy on Academic Honesty very carefully: https://sydney.edu.au/students/academic-integrity.html

Plagiarism (copying from another student, website or other sources), making your work avail- able to another student to copy, engaging another person to complete the assignments instead of you (for payment or not) are all examples of academic dishonesty. Note that when there is copy- ing between students, both students are penalised ‚Äì the student who copies and the student who makes his/her work available for copying. The University penalties are severe and include:

<pre>* a permanent record of academic dishonesty on your student file,
* mark deduction, ranging from 0 for the assignment to Fail for the course
* expulsion from the University and cancelling of your student visa.
</pre>
In addition, the Australian Government passed a new legislation last year (Prohibiting Aca- demic Cheating Services Bill) that makes it a criminal offence to provide or advertise academic cheating services ‚Äì the provision or undertaking of work for students which forms a substantial part of a student‚Äôs assessment task. Do not confuse legitimate co-operation and cheating!
